 # Satellite-Imagery-Density
Using a CNN to predict population density of census tracts given a satellite image

Used official census data to find latitude, longitude, and population density for every census tract in America
Downloaded satellite images using Earth Engine and geemap.
Used Keras and Tensorflow to construct a convolutional neural network.
